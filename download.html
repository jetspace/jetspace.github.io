    We are sorry, but JetSpace is not ready yet, not even in an alpha version, so please come
    back when it is finished / a bit further...
    <br>
    Anyways, if you want to try JetSpace at its current level of developement, you can visit our
    GitHub page and clone the Repo you want to try. But Please note: all of the tool/configs/scripts
    are not nearly stable, so you use it on your own risk and without any kind of warranty! For more
    details view our LICENSE files in the Repos.<br>
    However, we wish you good luck with JetSpace and do not forget to submit Bugs and Ideas!
