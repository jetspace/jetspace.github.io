      <p class="sub2_l">
        JetSpace is built on Linux! Linux is an open source project which
        was founded by Linus Torvalds. Today it is one of the most important
        operating systems in the world! Even large companies are using Linux
        on their infrastructure!
        <br>
        The open source developement has a lot of advantages for the users. For example
        Linux is very safe and there are almost no viruses for Linux based operating systems.
        This means that you do not have to install an anti virus tool.</p>
        <p class="sub2_r">This will
        save you money but also resources on your computer, because there is one
        application less running in the background!
        <br>
        And resources is the next advantage: Linux does not only run on new modern
        systems, it has quite low hardware requirements. JetSpace will follow the model
        of ArchLinux and we will support <b>all</b> computers which support <b>x86</b> or <b>x68_64</b>!

    <div class="content" id="userfriendly">
      <h1 class="heading">Userfriendly</h1>
      <p class="sub2_l">
        While ArchLinux&trade; is super fast and up to date, it can be quite hard
        for new users to understand how to use it! So we thought it would be good
        if there would be a way to get all the advantages of ArchLinux but also provide
        a simple user interface...<br></p>
        <p class="sub2_r">
        And then we created JetSpace! It should keep the advantages of ArchLinux but should
        also provide sytem level tools like an installer which should enable new users to
        use these advantages!
      </p>

      <h1 class="heading">SiDE</h1>
      <p class="sub2_l">
        JetSpace comes with a all new desktop enviroment: SiDE. SiDE is designed to work
        on low powered hardware but should still have a nice UI. So it basicly follows the same
        goals as JetSpace. SiDE is built with GTK3 which is a stable framework for user interfaces.</p>

        <p class="sub2_r">
        As the project continues we also try to implement as much XDG standards as possible to enable
        you to have a great user experience even across multiple enviroments!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="free">
      <h1 class="heading">Free</h1>
      <p class="sub2_l">
        JetSpace is completly free! It is build on ArchLinux&trade; which is also free!
        Everything we develope is licensed under the terms of the MIT/X11 license. It provides
        you nearly all rights and you can almost do anything what you want with our source code!</p>
        <p class="sub2_r">
        Many of the available and/or pre installed tools are licensed under the GPL license which also
        aims to make software avilable!
        <br>
        JetSpace does not cost anything! It is compleatly for free!
